This is my Punk API project.

It takes data from an API and displays each of its objects as cards on the screen. There is also a search bar which allows the user to find their desired product easier. 

I created this project through the use of tools and methods including but not limited to: React extenstion, JSX, SCSS, functions, arrays, objects, useState, useEffect, object destructuring, and child/parent components.

If I had more time to spend on this project, I would:
1. Add functionality to the filter buttons
2. Use routes
3. Make the page responsive to different widths
4. Improve aesthetics/ do more styling
5. Add more pseudocode to code
